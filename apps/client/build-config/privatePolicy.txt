Privacy Policy for Lumi

Last Updated: October 24, 2025

Lumi ("the App") is a local-first personal knowledge management system that works seamlessly even when offline. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.

Data Collection and Usage

1. Local Data Storage
Lumi operates on a "local-first" principle, meaning all your data is primarily stored on your device:
- Your documents, notes, and wiki content
- Your application settings and preferences
- Your organizational structure (spaces, pages, etc.)
- Any files you upload through the application

2. Machine Identification
To provide certain functionalities, Lumi generates a unique machine identifier using industry-standard libraries:
- This identifier is used solely for application functionality
- It is stored locally on your device
- It is not transmitted to any external servers under normal operation
- It helps maintain consistency in your local settings

3. File Handling
When you upload files through Lumi:
- Files are stored locally in your designated storage directory
- Files are never automatically transmitted to external servers
- You have full control over where your files are stored

4. Network Usage
Lumi may connect to the internet in the following scenarios:
- Application Updates: When checking for and downloading updates through secure channels
- Optional Sync Services: If you choose to enable synchronization between devices, data will be transmitted to servers you configure
- Real-time Collaboration: If you use collaborative features, data will be transmitted to servers you configure

5. Analytics and Telemetry
Lumi does not collect any analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics by default. We do not track your usage patterns, feature preferences, or any personal information.

Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties. Your data remains under your control. Lumi may interact with third-party services only if you choose to enable them:
- Synchronization Services: If you enable sync features, your data may be transmitted to servers you configure
- Collaboration Services: If you use real-time collaboration features, your data may be transmitted to servers you configure
- Update Services: Application updates are downloaded through standard secure update mechanisms

Your Rights and Choices

Since Lumi stores data locally, you have complete access to and control over your data:
- You can view all your data in the application's storage directory
- You can export your data at any time
- You can delete your data by removing the application's storage directory
- You can opt out of any network features by disabling synchronization and collaboration features

Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data:
- All data is stored locally on your device
- Optional encryption can be enabled for synchronization
- Access to your data requires access to your device

Children's Privacy

Lumi is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
