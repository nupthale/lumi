# Privacy Policy for Lumi

Last Updated: October 14, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use Lumi ("the App"), a local-first personal knowledge management system developed by nupthale.

This policy is designed to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with that data.

## What is Lumi?

Lumi is a local-first personal knowledge management system that works seamlessly even when offline. It supports real-time collaboration, Markdown editing, and block-level references, providing a Notion-like flexible page structure. Lumi enables individuals and teams to efficiently organize and manage knowledge, regardless of network connectivity.

## Data Collection and Use

### Local Data Storage
Lumi is designed with a "local-first" architecture, which means that all your data is primarily stored on your local device. This includes:

- Your documents and wiki content
- Your settings and preferences
- Your organizational structure (spaces, pages, etc.)
- Any files you upload through the application

### Machine Identification
To provide certain functionalities, Lumi generates a unique machine identifier using the `node-machine-id` library. This identifier:

- Is used solely for application functionality
- Is stored locally on your device
- Is not transmitted to any external servers under normal operation
- Helps maintain consistency in your local settings

### File Handling
When you upload files through Lumi:

- Files are stored locally in your designated storage directory
- Files are never automatically transmitted to external servers
- You have full control over where your files are stored

### Network Usage
Lumi may connect to the internet in the following scenarios:

1. **Application Updates**: When checking for and downloading updates (handled through Electron's auto-update mechanism)
2. **Optional Sync Services**: If you choose to enable synchronization between devices, data will be transmitted to your configured sync servers
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: If you use collaborative features, data will be transmitted to collaboration servers you configure

### Analytics and Telemetry
Lumi does not collect any analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics by default. We do not track your usage patterns, feature preferences, or any personal information.

## Third-Party Services

Lumi may interact with third-party services if you choose to enable them:

1. **Synchronization Services**: If you enable sync features, your data may be transmitted to servers you configure
2. **Collaboration Services**: If you use real-time collaboration features, your data may be transmitted to servers you configure
3. **Update Services**: Application updates are downloaded through standard Electron update mechanisms

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties. Your data remains under your control.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Data Access and Control
Since Lumi stores data locally, you have complete access to and control over your data:

- You can view all your data in the application's storage directory
- You can export your data at any time
- You can delete your data by removing the application's storage directory

### Opt-Out Options
You can opt out of any network features by:

- Disabling synchronization features
- Not using collaboration features
- Using Lumi in offline-only mode

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data:

- All data is stored locally on your device
- Optional encryption can be enabled for synchronization
- Access to your data requires access to your device

## Children's Privacy

Lumi is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
